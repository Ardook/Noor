**Noor**
Noor is an experimental yet powerful CUDA pathtracer (with support for multiple GPUs).  It started (Noor 1.0) as part of a final class project (real-time Whitted raytracer) in 2009 and was recently resurrected as a pathtracer to assist me in learning and reinforcing the ideas and the topics covered in the PBRT book. 
 
(##) Acceleration Data Structures:

* BVH
* SBVH (removed)

(##) Instancing:

* Multi-level BVH tree construction and traversal
* Support for large scenes with complex instancing of geometry

(##) Primitives:

* Triangles
* Implicit surfaces like quads, disks, spheres, and cylinders (mesh lights)

(##) Supported model/scene file formats:

* Alias Wavefront OBJ
* Autodesk FBX
   * Custom materials, lights, and cameras using MEL scripts

(##) Supported image formats

* JPG, jpg, TGA, BMP, PSD, GIF, HDR, PIC [(Sean Barrett)](https://github.com/nothings/stb). 
* EXR [(Syoyo Fujita)](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr).

(##) Supported lights:

* Environment lighting (HDR and physical sky)
* Distant lights
* Area lights
* Point lights
* Spot lights
* Mesh area lights (quad, sphere, and disk)
* Infinite/environment light with importance sampling
* Physical sun/sky (Hosek) with importance sampling  
   * Cuda port of the Hosek & Wilkie implementation [(Hosek & Wilkie Sun & Sky Model)](http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/projects/SkylightModelling/)

(##) Texture:

* HDR and LDR
* Mipmapping
* Point, bi-linear, tri-linear, EWA (anisotropic) sampling

* Environment (360 degrees)

(##) Work in Progress:

* Bidirectional path tracing
* Volume path tracing
* Subsurface scattering
* Multi-threaded BVH build
* Maya plugin
